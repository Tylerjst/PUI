                    <p>This is a website about voter suppression.</p>
                   
                    <p>It's admittedly a complicated subject to talk about. There’s a long history of governments discouraging or outright blocking People of Color from voting that must be learned to properly understand the context of current events. There’s also no one data set or event that one can point to to prove that voter suppression exists today. An advisor to Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams described it as <a href = "https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/brian-kemps-win-in-georgia-tainted-by-voter-suppression-stacey-abrams/" target = "_target">"death by a thousand paper cuts."</a> However, like Representative Sewell reasons, the lack of egregiousness does not disprove the existence nor impact of voter suppression.</p>
                    
                    <p>In contrast, voter fraud is demonstrably fictitious. Numerous studies have proven that concerns regarding fraudulent voting are hyperbolic and unfounded. While some instances of voter fraud have been proven and the perpatrators convicted, the pervasiveness of these events is nowhere near the claims made by politicians.</p>
                    
                    <p>Policies enacted to curb “voter fraud,” in addition to other policies, have targeted bystanders more often than the hypothesized criminals. Many claim these decisions, including implementing voter ID laws, reducing the number of polling locations, and reducing early voting, inhibit lawfully registered citizens from voting.</p>
                    
                    <p>As previously stated, there is admittedly little to no direct or quantitative data that uncovers the impact of these policies on voter turnout or election outcomes. There is no study that reveals how many votes candidate X lost out on because people didn’t have the photo ID required to vote in their state. </p>
                    
                    <p>However, when we plot the data we do have, we can begin to see trends emerge. For instance, we know that minority populations are less likely to have photo IDs than other ethnic groups. We know people of color are more likely to vote for democratic candidates. We have anecdotal and qualitative evidence of the voters having a more difficult time voting.</p>
                    
                    <p>While we can’t claim that an election was flipped because a state cut early voting, we can certainly claim that specific policies made it harder for some of its citizens to vote.</p>
                    
                    <p>And we can claim this more confidently than impersonation voter fraud, non-citizen voting, double voting, and other alleged fraudulent voting techniques. </p>
                    
                    <p>Intentionally maligned or not, voter suppression is real.</p>
